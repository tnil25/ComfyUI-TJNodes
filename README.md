# About

This custom node pack provides a suite of tools for compositing and visual effects workflows within ComfyUI. 
Most notably, it features a robust point tracker powered by Meta's CoTracker model, alongside other nodes 
designed to streamline masking, tracking, and compositing tasks.

# Point Tracker

The point tracker functions similarly to tracking tools found in professional software like After Effects and Blender.
By tracking up to two points, it can calculate and generate position, rotation, and scale data. After generating a successful track
you can then create a custom mask polygon that can be used in your workflow.
